# HealO.ai - 
## About
The goal is to create a healthcare diagnosis chatbot that assists users by analyzing their symptoms, utilizing databases that contain real doctor-patient conversations. The solution involves leveraging task-specific datasets, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks, vector databases, and quantized LLM fine-tuning (QLoRA). The system aims to improve LLM accuracy by providing it with external accurate data, based on the user's needs and to reduce LLM hallucinations via finetuning.
